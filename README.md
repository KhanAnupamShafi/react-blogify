# React Blogify

React Blogify is an API project designed to facilitate learning about integrating APIs with frontend applications, particularly in React. The API provides various endpoints for managing blog posts, user authentication, profile management, and interaction with blog content.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication:** Allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
2. **Blog Post Management:** Enables users to create, read, update, and delete their blog posts. Users can also like, comment on, and mark blog posts as favorites.
3. **Profile Management:** Provides endpoints for users to update their profile information, including name, bio, and avatar.

   - `/auth/refresh-token`: Refresh the access token using the refresh token.
2. **Blog Posts:**
   - `/blogs`: Retrieve all blog posts or create a new blog post.
   - `/blogs/:id`: Retrieve, update, or delete a specific blog post by ID.
   - `/blogs/:id/comment`: Add a comment to a specific blog post.

**Authentication and Authorization:**

- User authentication is implemented using JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to API endpoints.
- Access to certain endpoints, such as creating, updating, or deleting blog posts, requires authentication with valid JWT tokens.

**Usage:**

- Developers can use this API project to learn how to integrate backend APIs with React frontend applications.
- By exploring the provided endpoints, developers can understand how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts, manage user authentication, and update user profiles.

React Blogify API serves as an educational resource for developers aiming to enhance their skills in integrating APIs with React applications. With its comprehensive set of endpoints and user-friendly documentation, developers can effectively learn how to build interactive blog websites with React and backend APIs.
